# GitHub-GAS-tester

This is a Google App Script that allows you to pull a file from GitHub into a Google Document.

* It is based on a sample by Martin Hawksey https://mashe.hawksey.info. 

It also uses: 
* The oAuth2 library (by Eric Koleda)
* Hawskey's port of the GitHub.js wrapper around the GitHub API (which was created by Michael Aufreiter)
